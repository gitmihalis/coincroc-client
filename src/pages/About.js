		<h1>About</h1>
		
		<p>There are thousands of crypto-coins available you can exchange on the web today, but what do they all do and how are they related? It’s the aim of this website to classify them into their respective industries and expose high level trends within this emerging market from an investment perspective.</p>
		<p>Anyone and everyone can create their own crypto asset, and the cacauphony phasing out the market's signals is too much for a person or Artifical Intel to honestly isolate ( so far ). These assets can boom and bust in mere weeks. The majority of the <i>tokens</i> trading today will have swallowed up their value without any product or service to show for it. Right now there is little data to support which companies warrant a <i>digital asset</i> as a necessity to their sucess. That is going to change.</p>
		<p>A lexical, as well as a statistical analysis of cryptocurrencies in their respective sectors will aid in determining warranted & popular use-cases for <i>digital assets</i> as well as punctuating novel ventures or even explicit frauds. This site will build on the principle that economic markets are not simply put, "a numbers game". It's people who determine <strong>value</strong>. And At present, millions of people value Crypto.
