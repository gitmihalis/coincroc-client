					<h1>About</h1>
				
					<p>There are thousands of exchangable cryptocurrencies today, but what do the people and companies behind them do. Which ones are worth your investment and which are not? Itâ€™s the aim of this website to classify every tradable token into their respective industry, exposing high level trends within the cryptocurrency markets.</p>

					<p>Blockchain technology allows anyone to create and distribute their own digital assets. This has created a revolution in funding capital &amp; a wild west for investors. As a consequence, the majority of the <i>tokens</i> trading today will fail to develop their purported product or service &amp; swallow their value without anything to show for it. But this is a good thing! Those whom are free to fail, have the opportunity to succeed.</p>

					<p>As to which companies/entities warrant a <i>digital asset</i> for success, remains to be seen but we're very interested in finding out. Our Sectors Analysis is being developed to determine identifiable trends for profitable <i>digital assets</i> as well as the inverse. In the meantime, don't invest more than you can afford to lose.
